\title{Calculates the area of resilience to stress event below a baseline
with subtraction of area of growth and scaling for end state
growth or non-resilience.}
\usage{
arse_ts(data, xcoord, ycoord, ybase = NA, yend = NA, yinvert = FALSE,
  saveout = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A dataframe with x- and y-coordinates in wide format.}

\item{xcoord}{A specified selection of the x-coordinate values within
the dataframe. The first x-coordinate value should correspond to the baseline
input of 'y'.}

\item{ycoord}{A specified selection of the y-coordinate values within the
dataframe. The first y-coordinate value should correspond to the baseline value
of 'y'. The second y-coordinate value should be the first measure of 'y' after
the intrusion of a stress event. The last value of 'y' should correspond to
the last measurement of 'y' over the measured timeframe.}

\item{ybase}{A specified selection of the baseline of the 'y' measured variable.
Users are advised to place baseline as the first instance of the y-coordinate
values. Function defaults to use the first y-coordinate value in the series.}

\item{yend}{A specified selection of the end state of the 'y' measured variable.
Users are advised to place end state as the last instance of the y-coordinate
values. Function defaults to use the last y-coordinate value in the series.}

\item{yinvert}{Specifies whether resilience occurs above or below the baseline
depending on the meaning of high and low 'y' values. When parameter 'yinvert'
is set to 'FALSE' (the default), it is assumed that higher numbers are indicative
of positive (i.e., desired) 'y' values (e.g., exam grade). When 'yinvert' is set
to 'TRUE', it is assumed that lower numbers are indicative of positive
(i.e., desired) 'y' values (e.g., blood pressure).}

\item{saveout}{When the parameter 'saveout' is set to 'FALSE' (the default),
a vector of calculated arse_ts values are given for each case. When 'saveout' is
set to 'TRUE', a dataframe of the original inputted dataset is returned with a
new column of calculated arse_ts values.}

When the parameter 'saveout' is set to 'FALSE', a vector of calculated
arse_ts values are given for each case. When 'saveout' is set to 'TRUE', a

calculated arse_ts values.

\description{
This function takes a series of 'x,y' coordinates and a specified 'y'
baseline value. For a given set of x-coordinates over time and repeated
measures of a 'y' variable, this function calculates the area of
resilience to a stress event (arse) that is formed below the specified
baseline value of 'y' using an implementation of the shoelace formula
(Gauss's area formula) for the area of irregular polygons. The function
also calculates the area of growth (aog) that is formed above the specified
baseline in the same manner as arse. The function then subtracts the
arse from aog to get a new variable, arse_t. With arse_t calculated,
it is scaled in reference to the end state value by (a) if arse_t is
greater than or equal to zero, multiplying the arse_t value by the division
of baseline value over the end state value (i.e., last measured value of 'y')
or \eqn{arse value * (baseline value/end state value)} or (b) if arse_t is
less than zero, multiplying the arse_t value by the division of end state value
over the baseline value (i.e., last measured value of 'y') or
\eqn{arse value * (end state value/baseline value)}. Smaller arse_s values
are indicative of better resilience on the measured variable.
